#Proposed timeline
Kubernetes 1.5 is set to release on Dec 8, 2016.

December tends to have a lot of vacation time towards the end, and we want to have a little buffer time in case of slips.  As a result, we will begin the 1.6 release the first week of 2017.

The proposal below is identical in layout to the 1.4 and 1.5 plans:
- key days aren't Fridays, since it can be hard to end milestones right up against weekends
- there are fewer major holidays and vacation breaks this quarter 

##1.6 Overview
- Jan 3 (Tues) coding start (7w)
- Feb 24 (Fri) feature complete, move to bugfix (4w)
- March 22 (Weds) release

##1.5 Details

###Jan 3 - Feb 24
- 7 week coding period
- Release 1.5 alphas every 2 weeks

###Feb 24 - Mar 22
- Enter code slush on head, no more features or major refactors

- Start Milestone Burndown meetings
- Branch and cut Beta release on Mar 8 (Weds)

###Mar 8 - Mar 22
- Open head for 1.6 work on Mar 18, after branch

#Proposed timeline for 1.6
Since Kubernetes 1.5 is set to release on Dec 8, 2016, and December tends to have a lot of vacation time, we will begin the 1.6 release the first week of 2017.
We will use the time between releases for planning, designing and bugfixes.

The proposal below is identical in layout to the 1.4 and 1.5 plans:
- key days aren't Fridays, since it can be hard to end milestones right up against weekends
- there are fewer major holidays and vacation breaks this quarter 

##1.6 Overview
- Dec 8 - Jan 3: planning/design/bugfix period
- Jan 3 (Tues) coding start (7w)
- Jan 24 (Tues) features repo freeze
- Feb 27 (Mon) feature complete, move to bugfix (4w)
- March 22 (Weds) release

##1.6 Details

###Jan 3 - Feb 27
